# Project Description: Java Selenium BDD Automation Framework

## Overview:

This project aims to develop a robust and maintainable test automation framework using Java, Selenium WebDriver, and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles. The framework will facilitate automated testing of web applications, ensuring reliability and efficiency in the software delivery pipeline.

## **Technologies Used:**

Java: Programming language for writing test scripts and implementing the automation framework.
Selenium WebDriver: Tool for automating web browsers to simulate user interactions with web applications.
Cucumber: BDD framework for writing test scenarios in simple, human-readable language.
Maven: Dependency management and build automation tool for Java projects.
JUnit or TestNG: Testing frameworks for executing test cases and managing test reports.
Git: Version control system for collaborative development and source code management.
IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse): Integrated Development Environment for writing and running Java code.
Key Features:
Page Object Model (POM):
Implementing a structured approach to design page objects for web pages, encapsulating UI elements and actions within reusable classes.
Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):
Writing test scenarios in Gherkin language (Given-When-Then format) using Cucumber, enhancing collaboration between technical and non-technical team members.
Cross-Browser Testing:
Configuring Selenium WebDriver to run tests on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) to ensure application compatibility across platforms.
Parallel Execution:
Utilizing parallel test execution capabilities to expedite test runs and improve efficiency, leveraging TestNG or JUnit features.
Reporting and Logging:
Generating comprehensive test reports (HTML, XML) using frameworks like ExtentReports or Allure, with detailed insights into test execution results.
Continuous Integration (CI) Integration:
Integrating the automation framework with CI tools like Jenkins or Azure DevOps for automated builds, test executions, and seamless integration into the CI/CD pipeline.
Version Control:
Managing project source code, test scripts, and configuration files using Git repositories, ensuring version history and collaboration among team members.
Configuration Management:
Using properties or configuration files (e.g., properties files, YAML) to manage test data, environment URLs, and other parameters for test execution.
Project Structure:
src/main/java: Contains Java classes for implementing the automation framework, including page objects, utilities, and configuration files.

src/test/java: Houses test scripts written in Java, utilizing BDD with Cucumber for defining and executing test scenarios.

src/test/resources: Stores feature files written in Gherkin language, defining executable scenarios with steps mapped to Java methods.

pom.xml: Maven project configuration file specifying dependencies, plugins, and build settings.

# Goals:

Ensure Test Reliability: Develop robust test automation scripts that validate application functionalities accurately and consistently.

Enhance Test Efficiency: Implementing parallel execution and cross-browser testing to reduce test execution time and increase coverage.

Improve Collaboration: Using BDD approach with Cucumber to foster collaboration between business stakeholders, testers, and developers.

Facilitate Continuous Integration: Integrating with CI tools to automate test execution, ensuring early detection of defects and faster feedback loop.
